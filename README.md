Texture synthesis is the process of generating a larger texture image from a smaller source image. This project generates textures using an idea called image quilting, developed by Alexei A. Efros and William T. Freeman in their SIGGRAPH 2001 paper called Image Quilting for Texture Synthesis and Transfer.
